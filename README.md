# CA1_2D_Game
2D game engine CA1
(put references, video link into the readme file and add the video on youtube to play it (have backup if the internet crashes))

Original Idea:
- ufo trying to get from the planet earth to their home planet - different spheres
- horizontal movement only
- background moves vertically
- if they hit one of the object they lose one of three lives
    - if they get hit more and more smoke will come out of the ufo
    - after they loose their last life it will fall out of the game screen
- maybe can pick up some items that can regain their life, make them smaller, bigger, faster, etc.
- maybe can shoot down some object or make it purely just trying to avoid objects (birds, planes, comets, other object)


Things I want to implement:
- enemies will have different animations when just moving and after the player defeats them + explosion, can see enemy hp
- hp and power meter, when power at max = big shots
- score for every defeated enemy
- hp hit = -1, max health 20
- when ship moves changes animation plus engine animation
- when suffering damage - let the player know via animation
- randomly spawned enemies
- can collect stuff to increase hp, power + collect coins
- make ui menu - can pause game, start game, quit game, maybe options
- after getting defeated make another menu with final score and save their best score, so that they know they defeated it in the future
- play again button, store to buy stuff with the coins

Game Diary

- 13.10.
    - writing down the “story”, game mechanics and what kind of game objects will the game have
    - looking for sprite sheets and settling on space invaders inspired sprite sheet

- 14.10.
    - looking for 2D unity game tutorial
    - meddling with the sprite sheet for almost two hours
        - deleting the background (making it transparent)
        - slicing up the sprite sheet

16.10.

- tile palette
- getting rid of line in the background

17.10.

- added flying enemy script
- also they follow player when he gets too close

18.10.

- changed up a code a bit in flying enemy and chase control

21.10.

- found a tutorial on an enemy that moves and shoots towards the player
    - changed up the code a bit in the flying enemy to use the gizmo
    - added the shooting feature for the enemies
    - made some prefabs

22.10.
- added:
  -  another type of bullets
  -  enemies
  -  enemy spawner
  -  got rid of starting point
- had some problem with the code/how to do things
  -   in enemy spawner there is only one slot for enemy prefab (i needed three)
      - had to do three enemy spawners (not sure if that's right)
  - too many enemies spawning even though i have a limit
  - enemies not shooting "bullets"
